## About Vanta OS

Vanta OS is the central brain of the Vanta ecosystem — an AI-driven operating system that learns your biology, behavior, and ambition, then builds a personalized daily protocol around them.

It doesn't motivate you — it regulates you.
It doesn't react — it anticipates.

Every decision becomes data. Every habit becomes intelligence.
The longer you live inside Vanta, the smarter it becomes.

Vanta OS unites six layers of the system — Form, Fuel, Stack, Studio, Society, and Self — into one feedback loop that predicts, prevents, and optimizes performance across body, mind, and lifestyle.

Your digital twin connects wearables, biomarkers, recovery metrics, and rituals to deliver adaptive recommendations for training, nutrition, recovery, and supplementation — transforming health from something you chase into something that runs automatically.
